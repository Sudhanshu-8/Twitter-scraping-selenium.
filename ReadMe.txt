# Instructions for Repository Usage

We have two files: **Without_proxy** and **With_proxy**.

### Problem Description:  
- **With Proxy:** The proxy correctly fetches the IP address, but it struggles to load Twitter consistently. Only occasionally does it successfully load Twitter.  
- **Without Proxy:** Without using the proxy, it gives the expected output while using the same IP address.

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sudhanshu-8/Twitter-scraping-selenium.git
```

### **2. Navigate to the Folders**  
After cloning the repository, navigate to the folder where the files are located. Use the `cd` command:

```bash
cd Twitter-scraping-selenium
```

### **3. Read the README File**  
Each folder contains a **README** file with essential details. Open the **README.txt** file in each folder to understand:  
- **Proxy configuration instructions.**  
- **Specific troubleshooting steps.**

You can view the file in the terminal using commands like:

```bash
cat README.txt
```

or

```bash
less README.txt
```

Alternatively, you can open it in your preferred text editor. Make sure to **carefully review the README file in each folder** for detailed instructions and usage guidelines.
