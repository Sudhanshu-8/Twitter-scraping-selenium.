# There are two files: Without_proxy and With_proxy.

I was having problems using the proxy. The proxy correctly fetched the IP address, but when using that address, it is unable to load Twitter. Only a few times it successfully loads the Twitter.

On the other hand, in Without_proxy, where the proxy is not used, it gives the expected output with the same IP address.

Navigate to the Folders: After cloning the repository, navigate to the folder where the files are located. You can use the cd command in the terminal:

Read the README File: Open the README file in each folder to understand how the proxy configuration should be handled, and check if there are any specific instructions related to using proxies.

You can use cat, less, or open the file in any text editor:
