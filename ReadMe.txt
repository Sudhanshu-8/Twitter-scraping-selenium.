There are two files: Without_proxy and With_proxy.

I was having problems using the proxy. The proxy correctly fetched the IP address, but when using that address, it is unable to load Twitter. Only a few times it successfully loads the Twitter.

On the other hand, in Without_proxy, where the proxy is not used, it gives the expected output with the same IP address.
